    <h1>Focal Point Priorities</h1>
    <b>Preface:</b>
    <p>
      Hello all, this document is an exploration and justification for what to prioritize when developing a digital environment.
      The order of presentation will also be the order of importance so the first topic I speak about will be the one I consider the most important.
      Before we start, thank you for taking the time to consider my proposal.
    </p>
    <b>System Design, Engineering, and Organization:</b>
    <p>The most important part of development is how we organize ourselves and the project. 
      Without establishing the methods we are going to use, there is no real starting point for a project like this in the first place. 
      We need to decide the design philosophy we are going to use when we create anything. 
      We have choices that have upsides and downsides, for instance, if we use a user-centric design philosophy we will be focused on user experience, but other parts of the project may suffer due to that.</p>
      
    <p>We could also focus on a systems thinking philosophy, which I would personally prefer, so that we can link all of our parts together in a cohesive whole. A good example of a failure point in user-centric design comes from the first chapter in a book by Sheryl Cababa, ‘Closing the Loop’. She states that user centric design focuses on the user too much and lets other parts of the system rot and fail. </p>
      
    <p>For these reasons, we need to decide on our methodology first before we start work on anything else. Doing otherwise would most likely just waste time and money doing work that isn’t useful in the methodology we start using later.</p>
      
    <b>Content and Information Architecture:</b>

    <p>The second most important aspect to consider is our Information Architecture and the content it holds. How we design the environment we are crafting is very important, as Jorge Arango says in ‘Living in Information’, how we design our environments determines the function most of all. Failing to think about how our content, users, and the context both reside in will make our product useless. This can drive them away from our work and towards our competitors, which is not something we want. </p>

    <p>Figma gives us some good reasons to value Information Architecture, adhering to its principles helps with making content more navigable and makes important information easier to find. Information Architecture principles can also make changing parts of our project easier in the future and can make supporting our business objectives easier. All of these would be a great reason for Information Architecture to high up on the list of importance but all together it becomes necessary for success flat out.</p>
      
    <b>User Experience:</b>
      
    <p>User Experience or Usability is the third most important thing to consider. Just because it lies in third does not make it low priority however, the other two just need to be thought about first before we can bring these touches in. Working on the user experience at this point will allow us to fine tune our work to make the overall experience enjoyable for a user. To determine how we should tweak our work we would need to take part in usability testing. To get the best information possible we will need to watch how people behave in our environment, an article by Christian Rohrer by the name of ‘When to Use Which User-Experience Research Methods’ mentions that most usability research should watch overall behavior. However, the attitude of the user towards the environment can also be used, so it should be gathered as well. </p>
      
    <p>With this research we will be able to find weak points in our initial design that we can work on fixing. After that point we will need to do additional tests to make sure that our tweaks are making things better of course.</p>

    <b>Misinformation and Disinformation:</b>

    <p>The last topic I will cover here is Misinformation and Disinformation. We need to ensure that we minimize false information in the environment we are going to create. Protecting our work from false information will help build credibility with the public and could lead to us becoming a preferred option. To help do this an article by Aliza Vigderman called ‘Misinformation and Disinformation: A Guide for Protecting Yourself’ many ways that you can protect a single person for false information, but it can also apply to us looking for data on a larger scale. The biggest few habits we should develop are, one, verifying everything, two, use diverse sources of information, and three, fact check everything before we post it on our website. </p>

    <p>If we use all of these habits in combination with the other three sections, we should be able to make a successful and popular digital environment. I can guarantee that if we don’t at least consider these points the process will take longer and require much more time and revising before we are ready to ship a final product.</p>
